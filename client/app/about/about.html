    <p>BetaFish was born out of a real desire to know more about our products.</p>
    <p>Like many of you, we understood the value of making product decisions based on user feedback, but we found the traditional task of constantly seaking feedback and translating it into actionable insights to be daunting. There's a time and place for full-fledged, in-person usability testing, but going to that extent during every release cycle was simply not something we had the resources to do.</p>
    <p>We wanted a way to get just the feedback we needed to guide or process and we wanted to control how much of it we were collecting, who we were collecting it from and when.</p>
    <p>Unlike other feedback widgets, we focus on product design research, rather than customer support. We'll leave the customer support work to other apps like <a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank">Intercom</a>, which we love!</p>
    <p>In other words, we didn't create BetaFish to be a tool for your support team. BetaFish is a tool for product managers and designers to collect user experience data on what they need to make decisions and validate features.</p>
    <p>BetaFish is flexible and unassuming. You can choose to passively collect general feedback or ask specific questions by creating surveys. You can use it on your staging environment in a different way than you do on production. You can choose to collect feedback from any visitor or a selected few. You can choose to receive feedback anywhere in your app or create your own checkpoints that trigger BetaFish at key points in your user experience.</p>
    <p>How else can we put it? BetaFish is one smart fish.</p>
