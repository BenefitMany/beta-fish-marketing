    <p>BetaFish is one smart fish. Add it to your app and tell it when and where to collect feedback, otherwise it will stay out of sight.</p>
    <h3 class="bf-headline">Get more detail from your feedback</h3>
    <p>BetaFish provides all the detail you need to properly diagnose feedback. You can also feed custom user data to BetaFish via our javascript API, and we’ll surface those user details in the feedback tickets when they get submitted.</p>
